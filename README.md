## How to start a program?

1. Make sure that your terminal is **IN** the `backend` folder, **NOT** the `project` folder itself.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`. Then, you should see `Listening on port 8000` in your terminal.
4. Open a `index.html` in the `frontend` folder. Then, you are ready! :D
5. If you want to quit the program, enter `Ctrl + C` or `Command + C` on your terminal.
